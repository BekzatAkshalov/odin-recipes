    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>At its core, Beshbarmak is a meat-and-noodles dish. Traditionally made with horse or lamb meat due to their availability on the steppes, it can also be prepared with beef or chicken in modern times. The meat is boiled until tender then shredded into bite-sized pieces. The noodles are handmade from flour and water rolled out into thin sheets then cut into squares or rectangles. These are boiled until soft then layered onto a platter with the cooked meat on top. Onions sauteed in sheep fat add flavor to the broth which is poured over the assembled dish before serving. Fresh herbs like dill or parsley may also be sprinkled on top as garnish.</p>

       <li>Assemble your Beshbarmak by layering noodles onto a platter followed by shredded meat on top.</li>
